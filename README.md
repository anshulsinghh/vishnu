# Vishnu

## Info
Vishnu is a discord bot currently running on the <heaven> server. This project was started on May 17, 2017, and is still an active and ongoing project.

## Code
Use the `index.js` file to start the project. All of the commands are in a `commands` subfolder, events like `client.on('ready')` are in an `events` subfolder, json files are in the `storage` and `util` folders, and all of the website files are in the `website` subfolder. Node.js's filesystem plugins allow the `index.js` file to access every file in the bot's directory. The dependencies listed in the `package.json` file should be installed before running the bot.
